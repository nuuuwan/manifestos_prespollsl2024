## Most unrealistic promises

Evaluating the realism of political promises requires considering factors such as economic feasibility, administrative capacity, social and political conditions, and historical precedents. Here are 10 promises from the manifesto that could be considered unrealistic, along with explanations:

1. **Reclaiming Wealth from Corrupt Elite Ruling Groups**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: While combating corruption is essential, the idea of reclaiming significant amounts of wealth looted over decades is challenging. It requires extensive legal processes, international cooperation, and political will, which are difficult to coordinate. Historical examples show that such efforts often meet with limited success.

2. **Universal Free and High-Quality Education with 6% of GDP Allocation**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: Allocating 6% of GDP to education is an ambitious target. Given Sri Lanka’s economic constraints and other pressing needs (such as healthcare and debt servicing), achieving this without significant economic growth or external aid seems unlikely.

3. **A Circular Economy Transition Across All Sectors**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: The transition to a circular economy, especially in sectors like agriculture, energy, and construction, is a long-term goal requiring massive investment, technological innovation, and behavioral change across society. Achieving this within a single government term seems overly optimistic.

4. **50% Women’s Representation in All Decision-Making Bodies**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: While increasing women’s representation is critical, reaching 50% in all decision-making bodies, from Parliament to local government, involves not only legislative changes but also shifts in societal attitudes, which typically take time and consistent effort to achieve.

5. **Providing a Monthly Allowance of Rs. 10,000 to Low-Income Families and Persons with Disabilities**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: While this promise addresses a crucial need, funding such a large-scale welfare program without a significant increase in government revenue or cuts in other areas is difficult, especially given Sri Lanka’s current fiscal challenges.

6. **Eradicating All Forms of Corruption**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: While reducing corruption is necessary, completely eradicating it is extremely challenging, given entrenched interests, systemic issues, and the complexity of governance. Even in countries with strong institutions, corruption persists at some level.

7. **A Modernized Tourism Industry as an Attractive Global Destination**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: Transforming Sri Lanka into a leading global tourist destination requires overcoming significant challenges, such as infrastructure development, political stability, and competition from other established tourist hotspots. Achieving this within a short period is ambitious.

8. **A Fully Digitized and Efficient Public Service**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: While digitization of public services is crucial, fully achieving this across all sectors of government requires substantial investment in technology, training, and change management, which is a lengthy and resource-intensive process.

9. **A National Sports Commission Ensuring Standards and Equity in All Sports**:
   - **Why Unrealistic**: Establishing a commission that ensures equity across all sports and rapidly improves Sri Lanka's international standing is challenging. It requires overcoming entrenched interests, ensuring widespread access to resources, and competing with nations that have far more developed sports infrastructures.

10. **A New Constitution Uniting All Ethnic Groups into a Unified Sri Lankan Nation**:
    - **Why Unrealistic**: While a new constitution is a powerful tool for national unity, the deep-seated ethnic tensions and political divisions in Sri Lanka make it extremely difficult to draft and pass a constitution that satisfies all parties. The process would require extensive negotiation, compromise, and likely face significant opposition.

These promises, while noble in intention, face significant hurdles in terms of implementation, given Sri Lanka’s current socio-economic and political landscape. They require careful planning, substantial resources, and time beyond the tenure of a single government.

Here are the top 5 reasons to vote for the National People’s Power (NPP) party, as well as the top 5 reasons not to vote for them:

## Top 5 Reasons to Vote for this Party

1. **Strong Anti-Corruption Stance**:
   - The NPP promises to eradicate deeply entrenched corruption in Sri Lanka’s political system. They aim to establish an independent judiciary and reclaim wealth looted by corrupt elites, which resonates with voters tired of corrupt governance.

2. **Focus on a Production-Based Economy**:
   - The NPP prioritizes developing a production-based economy, leveraging Sri Lanka’s natural resources, technology, and creative industries. This approach is designed to boost the economy, create jobs, and reduce reliance on imports, which could be appealing to those concerned about economic stagnation.

3. **Commitment to Social Justice and Equality**:
   - The NPP has a strong focus on social justice, including gender equality, representation for marginalized groups, and comprehensive social welfare programs. This inclusive approach is likely to appeal to voters who prioritize human rights and social equity.

4. **Environmental Sustainability**:
   - The party emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and sustainable development, including transitioning to a circular economy and promoting renewable energy. For environmentally conscious voters, this is a significant reason to support the NPP.

5. **Education and Health as Priorities**:
   - The NPP pledges to increase investment in education and health, making these sectors accessible and high-quality. Their plan to integrate Western and Indigenous healthcare systems and provide free, equitable education aligns with voters who prioritize public services.

## Top 5 Reasons Not to Vote this Party

1. **Overly Ambitious Promises**:
   - Some of the NPP’s promises, such as completely eradicating corruption, reclaiming looted wealth, or transitioning entirely to a circular economy, may seem unrealistic or difficult to achieve within a single government term. Voters may be skeptical of the feasibility of these goals.

2. **Economic Feasibility Concerns**:
   - The party’s promises, such as increasing education spending to 6% of GDP or providing significant social welfare benefits, raise questions about how these initiatives will be funded, especially given Sri Lanka’s current fiscal challenges. Voters might be concerned about potential tax increases or budget deficits.

3. **Potential Resistance to Radical Changes**:
   - The NPP’s plans for sweeping reforms in areas like the constitution, public services, and governance structures could face significant resistance from established political and economic elites. Voters might worry about the potential for political instability or pushback.

4. **Limited Experience in Governance**:
   - The NPP, as a relatively new and emerging political force, may lack the experience in governance compared to more established parties. Voters may doubt the party’s ability to navigate the complexities of government and implement its ambitious agenda effectively.

5. **Risk of Economic Disruption**:
   - The focus on a production-based economy and a shift away from certain traditional sectors could lead to short-term economic disruption. Voters who prefer stability over rapid change might be wary of the potential economic impact of the NPP’s policies.

These pros and cons reflect the NPP's bold and ambitious platform, which may appeal to some voters while raising concerns for others.
