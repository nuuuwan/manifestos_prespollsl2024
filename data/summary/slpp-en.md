## Most Unrealistic Promises

Here are some promises in the manifesto that might be considered unrealistic, given the current economic, political, and social context of Sri Lanka:

1. **Achieving a GDP of Over USD 180 Billion in the Next Decade**: While setting ambitious economic goals is common, increasing the GDP to over USD 180 billion in a decade may be overly optimistic given the current economic challenges, including high debt levels, low foreign reserves, and a struggling export sector. Achieving such a target would require sustained high growth rates, which may be difficult in the face of global economic uncertainties and domestic constraints.

2. **Positive Trade Balance for the First Time Since 1977**: The promise to achieve a positive trade balance within the next decade is ambitious. Sri Lanka has long struggled with trade deficits, and reversing this trend would require significant increases in exports and/or reductions in imports, which may not be feasible without drastic and sustained changes in the economy.

3. **Reducing Public Debt to 80% of GDP**: The manifesto targets reducing public debt to 80% of GDP, which would be a significant improvement from current levels. Given the high levels of existing debt, ongoing budget deficits, and the need for continued borrowing to finance development projects, achieving this target could be challenging without severe austerity measures or exceptional economic growth.

4. **Stabilizing the Rupee and Maintaining a Stable Exchange Rate**: The promise to stabilize the rupee against the dollar, especially in the current global economic environment, could be difficult to achieve. Exchange rate stability is influenced by multiple external factors, including global market fluctuations, which may be beyond the control of domestic policies.

5. **Ensuring Three Healthy Meals a Day for Every Citizen**: While this is a noble goal, the logistics of ensuring that every citizen has access to three healthy meals a day may be unrealistic given the current economic conditions, poverty levels, and potential issues in the distribution of resources.

6. **Developing Sri Lanka as a Major Renewable Energy Exporter**: The manifesto promises to make Sri Lanka a regional center for renewable energy export, which would require massive investments in renewable energy infrastructure and technology. Given the current state of the energy sector and financial constraints, this could be an overly ambitious target.

7. **Achieving Single-Digit Inflation and Interest Rates**: Maintaining single-digit inflation and interest rates over the long term may be difficult, particularly in an economy facing significant structural challenges, including high levels of public debt, fluctuating commodity prices, and global economic pressures.

8. **Transforming Sri Lanka into a Leading Global Health and Wellness Service Center**: The idea of turning Sri Lanka into a global hub for health and wellness services, including attracting large numbers of foreign patients, might be overly ambitious given the current state of the healthcare system and competition from more established medical tourism destinations.

9. **Training and Exporting Large Numbers of Skilled Workers**: The plan to rapidly train and export skilled workers in high-demand fields like IT, engineering, and healthcare assumes a high level of success in education and training programs. The scale and speed at which this is proposed may be difficult to achieve, especially given the current state of the education system.

10. **Rapid Modernization of the Public Sector**: The manifesto promises significant modernization of the public sector through e-governance and ICT systems, which would require substantial investment, training, and overcoming bureaucratic inertia. The timeline and scale of these changes might be overly optimistic.

These promises, while well-intentioned, may face significant practical challenges, making them difficult to achieve within the proposed timeframes and under the current circumstances.

Voters may be attracted to these bold economic plans that aim to stabilize and grow the economy.

2. **Immediate Relief Measures**: The manifesto includes promises for immediate tax relief, reduced utility bills, and strengthened welfare programs like Samurdhi. These measures are likely to appeal to voters who are currently struggling with high living costs and economic hardship.

3. **Focus on Innovation and Public Sector Modernization**: The party plans to modernize the public sector through e-governance and introduce new ICT systems, making government services more efficient and accessible. This focus on modernization and transparency might attract voters who desire a more efficient and less corrupt government.

4. **Infrastructure Development**: The party pledges significant investments in infrastructure, including the development of ports, airports, highways, and economic zones. Voters who prioritize infrastructure and economic development may find this appealing.

5. **Commitment to Social Welfare and Education**: The manifesto outlines plans to improve education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. The focus on ensuring three healthy meals a day for every citizen and improving educational opportunities might resonate with voters concerned about social equity and development.

## Top 5 Reasons Not to Vote for This Party

1. **Overly Ambitious Economic Goals**: The economic targets set by the party, such as achieving a GDP of USD 180 billion, a positive trade balance, and reducing public debt to 80% of GDP, may seem unrealistic given the current economic challenges. Voters might be skeptical about the feasibility of these promises.

2. **Lack of Specificity in Addressing Current Issues**: While the manifesto presents broad goals, it may lack specific, actionable plans to address some of the pressing issues, such as the ongoing economic crisis, public debt management, and corruption. Voters looking for detailed and realistic solutions might be concerned.

3. **Potential Overemphasis on Nationalism**: The manifesto’s strong focus on protecting the unitary state, non-aligned foreign policy, and nurturing the Buddha Sasana might alienate voters who prefer a more inclusive approach that embraces all ethnic and religious groups equally.

4. **Limited Emphasis on Environmental Sustainability**: Although the manifesto mentions environmental sustainability, it may not provide enough concrete measures to address environmental issues. Voters concerned about climate change and environmental protection might find the plans insufficient.

5. **Continuity of Past Policies**: The party's heavy reliance on the legacy of Mahinda Rajapaksa and the continuation of Mahinda Chinthana policies might be viewed negatively by voters who associate these with past governance failures, such as increased public debt, corruption, and authoritarianism. Voters looking for a fresh approach may be deterred.

These points provide a balanced view of the potential strengths and weaknesses of the party based on the manifesto, helping voters make an informed decision.
