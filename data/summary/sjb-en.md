## Most unrealistic promises

Here are 10 promises from the manifesto that could be considered unrealistic, along with explanations:

1. **Achieving 70% Renewable Energy by 2030**:
   - **Explanation**: While the goal of 70% renewable energy generation by 2030 is ambitious and noble, achieving it in Sri Lanka's current economic and technological context may be challenging. The significant upfront investments required, coupled with the need for technological advancements and infrastructure, make this target potentially unrealistic within the given timeframe.

2. **Creating 25 Cutting-Edge IT Parks**:
   - **Explanation**: Establishing 25 IT parks in a short period is highly ambitious. The financial, logistical, and human resource constraints make this promise difficult to achieve. The current state of infrastructure, as well as the need for skilled labor and technological support, further complicates this goal.

3. **Transforming Every School into a Smart School**:
   - **Explanation**: While the idea of making every school a smart school is commendable, it is unrealistic due to the significant disparities in resources across the country's educational institutions. Many schools still lack basic amenities like electricity and water, making the leap to fully digitized smart schools a huge challenge.

4. **Eradicating Corruption Completely**:
   - **Explanation**: Although strong anti-corruption measures are essential, the promise of eradicating corruption entirely is unrealistic. Corruption is deeply entrenched in many systems, and while it can be significantly reduced, completely eliminating it is an overly optimistic goal that may not be fully achievable.

5. **Achieving Gross National Happiness (GNH) as a Core Economic Indicator**:
   - **Explanation**: Incorporating GNH as a core indicator is an innovative idea, but it may not be practical given the complex and subjective nature of happiness as a measurable metric. Economic and social conditions in Sri Lanka might make it difficult to use GNH as a reliable or actionable tool for policy-making.

6. **Overhauling the Entire Public Service Through Digitalization**:
   - **Explanation**: The complete digitalization of public services in a short timeframe is overly ambitious. The existing challenges with IT infrastructure, digital literacy among public servants, and the scale of bureaucratic systems make this a difficult promise to fulfill quickly.

7. **Providing Free Public Transportation to All Teachers**:
   - **Explanation**: While this is a generous promise, it may not be financially sustainable or logistically feasible on a national scale. The costs associated with providing free transportation to all teachers could strain public finances and lead to challenges in implementation.

8. **Building a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) Within Two Years**:
   - **Explanation**: The creation of a fully operational DPI within two years is ambitious. The complexities involved in integrating systems, ensuring data security, and achieving nationwide digital literacy and access pose significant challenges that could delay or impede this goal.

9. **Guaranteeing Up to 15% Savings Interest Rate for Senior Citizens**:
   - **Explanation**: Offering such a high guaranteed interest rate in a volatile economic environment could be financially unsustainable. This promise could strain the banking sector and government finances, especially if inflation remains high or if there is a need for fiscal tightening.

10. **Launching a Universal Contributory Pension Scheme**:
    - **Explanation**: Implementing a universal contributory pension scheme accessible to all citizens is an admirable goal, but it may be unrealistic given the current fiscal constraints and the complexity of transitioning from existing pension systems. The financial burden on both the government and individuals could make this difficult to achieve effectively.

These promises, while well-intentioned, face significant practical, financial, and logistical hurdles that may make them difficult to fully realize within the proposed timelines or to the extent promised.
