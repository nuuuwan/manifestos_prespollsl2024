3. **Tax Relief and Reform**: Plans to revisit tax slabs, reduce indirect taxes, and provide relief to professionals and entrepreneurs once the economy stabilizes, while aiming to increase tax revenue through improved collection efficiency.

4. **Poverty Reduction**: Aiming to reduce the population suffering from extreme poverty from 25% to 10% within five years through national social protection programs and infrastructure projects aimed at empowering underprivileged communities.

5. **Sustainable and Modernized Agriculture**: Introducing modern agro-culture with a focus on high-value crops for export, efficient water management, and support for farmers through direct subsidies and modern technology.

6. **Ocean Economy and Fisheries**: Plans to maximize the potential of Sri Lanka’s oceans by modernizing the fisheries sector and promoting offshore resources, including freshwater fisheries, prawn farming, and ornamental fish industries.

7. **Tourism Development**: Doubling tourist arrivals and increasing tourist income by upgrading infrastructure, creating tourist zones, and promoting high-end tourism in key areas like Colombo, Kandy, and the coastal regions.

8. **Energy and Green Economy**: Targeting 70% of energy from renewable sources by 2030 and establishing Sri Lanka as a green energy hub capable of exporting energy to neighboring countries.

9. **Digital Transformation**: Comprehensive digitalization of the public sector, promoting AI and automation across industries, and establishing a Digital Transformation Agency, with goals to raise the digital economy's value from $5 billion to $15 billion in five years.

12. **Tackling Corruption**: Implementing anti-corruption laws and an anti-corruption agenda, including measures to recover stolen assets and ensure transparency in public procurement and government dealings.

These promises focus on economic stability, sustainable growth, poverty reduction, modernization, and social equity.

## Most unrealistic promises

Some promises in the manifesto may be considered unrealistic due to their ambitious nature, potential challenges in implementation, or reliance on external factors. Here are a few that might be seen as less feasible:

1. **Rapid Reduction of Inflation to 2.81%**: The claim of reducing inflation from 70% in 2022 to 2.81% by July 2024 seems overly optimistic. Drastic drops in inflation are difficult to achieve in such a short period, especially in a recovering economy, without external economic shocks or a radical shift in internal policies.

2. **Achieving 70% Renewable Energy by 2030**: While the goal of transitioning to 70% renewable energy is admirable, it is quite ambitious. Achieving this target in less than a decade requires massive investments in infrastructure, technology, and expertise, which may be difficult given the current financial constraints of the country.

3. **Becoming a Green Energy Hub and Exporting Energy**: The plan to make Sri Lanka a green energy hub and export energy to India and neighboring countries may be unrealistic without substantial regional collaboration, massive technological investments, and the development of international-standard energy infrastructure.

4. **Doubling Tourism and Increasing Tourist Revenue by 500%**: The goal to increase tourist arrivals from 2.5 million to 5 million within five years and raise income per tourist from $150 to $500 could be overambitious, especially considering the current global tourism climate and economic challenges. Competing with established global tourist destinations will require extensive infrastructure development, which may take longer than anticipated.

5. **Self-Sufficiency in Dairy Production by 2035**: The plan to increase annual dairy production from 380 million liters to 820 million liters and achieve self-sufficiency by 2035 seems overly optimistic. The current inefficiencies in the dairy sector, such as low yields per cow, require significant reform, technological upgrades, and investments that may take longer than projected.

6. **Building a Debt-Free Economy by 2048**: The manifesto's promise to build a debt-free, developed economy by 2048 seems highly ambitious given the current economic situation. This goal would require strict fiscal discipline, sustained high growth rates, and avoiding any major economic downturns or global financial crises.

7. **Complete Digitalization and Shift to e-Governance in 3 Years**: While digital transformation is crucial, fully digitizing the public sector and shifting to e-governance within three years may be unrealistic. This would require overcoming significant bureaucratic hurdles, ensuring widespread digital literacy, and investing in technology infrastructure, all of which may take more time than projected.

8. **Providing Land or Houses to Every Citizen**: The promise to ensure that every citizen owns a plot of land or a house could be seen as unrealistic due to the sheer scale of the initiative, land availability issues, and the massive financial resources required. This also depends on effective land reform policies, which have historically been difficult to implement.

9. **Transforming Sri Lanka into a Major Economic Power through the Northern Province**: While revitalizing the Northern Province is a noble goal, turning it into a major economic stronghold might be overly optimistic, especially given the decades of economic neglect, political tensions, and the need for massive infrastructure and social investments.

10. **Comprehensive Healthcare Modernization and Expansion within 15 Years**: The promise to modernize healthcare facilities, offer international-level treatments, and expand hospitals in proportion to population growth within 15 years could face delays due to financial constraints, lack of skilled labor, and bureaucratic challenges.

These promises, while aspirational, may face significant practical and financial hurdles that could delay or prevent their full realization within the stated time frames.

## Top 5 Reasons to Vote for this Party

1. **Comprehensive Economic Plan (Theravada Trade Economy)**:
   The manifesto proposes a well-rounded economic revival plan based on the Theravada Trade Economy, focusing on export-driven growth, reduced reliance on debt, and rebuilding Sri Lanka’s historical role as an economic hub. This plan offers a clear direction for reducing debt, stimulating economic growth, and increasing foreign exchange.

2. **Commitment to Reducing Cost of Living**:
   The party has outlined specific measures to reduce the cost of living, including lowering utility bills, stabilizing the currency, and tackling inflation. If successful, this could bring immediate relief to citizens struggling with high costs of basic necessities.

3. **Focus on Green Energy and Sustainability**:
   The party's focus on transforming Sri Lanka into a green energy hub with a target of 70% renewable energy by 2030 shows a forward-thinking, environmentally conscious approach that could position the country as a leader in sustainable development.

4. **Job Creation and Export Growth**:
   The plan includes initiatives for creating new jobs and expanding export sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, and manufacturing. A special focus on modernizing the agricultural sector and boosting tourism shows a commitment to long-term economic sustainability.

5. **Anti-Corruption Agenda**:
   The party's commitment to reducing corruption through modern anti-corruption laws, transparency measures, and asset recovery shows a strong stance on governance. If fully implemented, this could restore public trust and reduce inefficiencies in the government.

## Top 5 Reasons Not to Vote this Party

1. **Unrealistic Economic Promises**:
   Some economic goals, such as achieving a debt-free economy by 2048 and dramatically reducing inflation in a short time frame, appear overly optimistic. The practicality of these promises may be questioned, especially given Sri Lanka’s current economic challenges.

2. **Heavy Reliance on External Factors (IMF, Foreign Investments)**:
   The manifesto heavily relies on external assistance and foreign investment, particularly from the IMF and countries like India and China. If these partnerships falter or conditions become unfavorable, the party’s ability to implement its economic plans may be severely hindered.

3. **Ambitious Green Energy Targets**:
   The goal of reaching 70% renewable energy by 2030 is laudable, but it may be overly ambitious without the necessary infrastructure and funding. The timeline might be too short for such a large-scale transition, which could lead to unmet expectations.

4. **Potential for Widening Inequality**:
   While the manifesto outlines many economic reforms, the focus on export-driven industries, privatization, and public-private partnerships could potentially widen the gap between the wealthy and the poor, especially if social safety nets are not effectively implemented.

5. **Lack of Detail on Implementation**:
   While the manifesto outlines several large-scale reforms, such as digitalization and modernizing healthcare and education, it lacks detailed implementation strategies and timeframes. This lack of clarity may lead to doubts about whether the ambitious plans can be successfully executed.
