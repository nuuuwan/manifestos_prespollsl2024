Preface
T
he social transformation Sri Lanka needs today is not a mere change of government
or ˛lling of the spaces le˙ by the departure of a ruling group. It is a massive social
transformation beyond the reformation of just one or two sectors Œ in essence, a
renaissance. It is the realization of the dream of a developed Sri Lanka that was stiˆed
by corruptregimesofthe past. ˝isis the dreamofpioneeringindividuals produced by
Sri Lanka in the post-independence period in various ˛elds, such as engineering, health,
education, art, literature, and human rights, who tried to lay solid foundations within those
˛elds. Governance under the NPP will become a renaissance era because this dream that
emerged in the twentieth century but was stiˆed and squandered can ˛nally be realized in
the twenty-˛rst century.
Developing a production-based economy is our singular aim and guiding principle.
For this reason, many of our policies are focused on areas such as mineral resources,
information and so˙ware technology, tourism industry, agriculture, marine resources,
and creative industries (e.g., art, cinema, literature, music, theatre, etc.) that can utilize
resources found within the country, be easily developed, and can be mobilized by the
professional and trained labour resources we already have. Science and technology will be
the key players in our proposed production-based economy.
NPP regards education, health, and transportation as essential public services and plans
to increase resource allocation in all these ˛elds. We believe that education is a primary
responsibilityofthegovernment,andtherefore,wecommittoreducingtheburdenof
education placed on parents. Furthermore, eˇorts will be made to gradually eliminate the
disparity in education across the country resulting from the inequality in the distribution
of resources. Vocationaleducationwillbe mainstreamedaspartof thenationaleducation
policy to ˛ll the gap between education and the job market. We see vocational education as
asigni˛cantfactorindevelopingtheprofessionalsneededtocreateaproductioneconomy.
Ourhealthpolicyfocusesonincreasing˛nancialallocationstothepublichealthsector
to develop it as an eˇective public service. Further, we propose integrating the Western
medical system with the Indigenous and Ayurvedic medical systems currently practised
in the country and providing a high-quality and eˇective healthcare service to the public.
Strengthening the state share in public transport and creating an e˜cient public transport
system in the country, regardless of whether it is day or night, is a cornerstone in the
multifaceted measures NPP plans to apply to the transport sector. We will move away from
6
anthropocentric thinking that places man as the sole owner of the earth, which conˆicts
with nature and aims to co-exist with all elements of the environment to maintain the
balanceofecosystems.˝isfoundationwillsupporttherealitiesofasystematicjourney
that is required for the economy to become a circular economy. We plan for the energy
sector to be based on renewable energy sources, agriculture to become a practice that does
not destroy ecosystems, and the construction industry to follow ﬁgreenﬂ practices.
ﬁGahenu Api Eka Mitataﬂ is an exemplary women™s movement that can be named as one
of the biggest and most eˇective women™s activist movements in Sri Lanka™s history. ˝e
goal of the NPP is to create a society where women, who represent half of the country™s
population, enjoy equal rights, free from physical, verbal and emotional violence.
Guided by this vision, our priority will be to uphold and introduce laws in alignment
with international charters we have already signed and establish necessary protection
mechanisms,leadingtothetransformationofattitudesandinstitutionalchanges.Ourgoal
is to gradually increase the representation of womento 50% in alldecision-making bodies,
from Parliament to local government institutions. Apart from this, another important
vision of the NPP is to produce a cultured human being. Under our government, we
believe in the transformational power of turning those who currently lack heart, care, and
warmthŠwho live mechanical lives and do not consider othersŠinto citizens who think
of others, engage with art and philosophy, embrace humanity, and ˛nally enjoy life. While
the current regime leaves the entire burden of cost-of-living on people, we, the NPP, will
absorbasubstantialpartofthisresponsibilityintothegovernment.Enhancingthequality
of life and ease of living in a developed production economy will lay the foundation for
creating a cultured society.
An NPP government will be dedicated to eradicating the deeply entrenched corruption that
hasplaguedourpoliticalcultureoverthepast76yearsandwillworktowardsestablishinga
more favourable and ethical political environment. Under our rule, reclaiming the wealth
looted by corrupt elite ruling groups will begin, ultimately returning this wealth to the
people.Toachievethis,wewillguidetheAnti-CorruptionCommission,thePolice,and
the Attorney General™s Department by enacting necessary laws and ensuring they operate
with full independence and authority.
Criminalswillbeheldaccountableaswewillexposeallinformationrelatedtomurders,
includingtheEasterSundayAttacksandthemurdersofjournalists,sports˛gures,
and targeted groups, which have been le˙ unresolved. Additionally,we are committed
to eradicating fraud and corruption at all levelsŠfrom kickbacks and commissions to
briberyŠwhether in massive development projects or something as basic as enrolling a
child to school.
For the ˛rst time in Sri Lanka™s post-independence history, governance will shi˙ from the
control of a few corrupt elite families to a people™s government. From the presidency to
every representative body and operational mechanism in the country, all positions will be
free from elite family connections and will be ˛lled by the children of ordinary citizens
produced through free education. An NPP government will usher in a new era of citizen
activism, collective intervention, social justice, and the application of good governance
principles. ˝e elitist relationship between rulers and the people that has existed since
independence will be replaced by a new social contractŠone of proud citizens and
leaders who are friends of the people they serve. A fundamental step towards this goal
is introducing a governmental structure where citizens can conduct their aˇairs without
relying on politicians. ˝e NPP rejects the notion of a Prince Diyasen, King, or Hero who
7
can single-handedly save the country. Instead, it views governance and development as
a collective eˇort. In this new system, less quali˛ed political henchmen will be replaced
by competent individuals appointed through a speci˛c merit-based process, and these
institutions will be allowed to function without political interference. ˝e independence
of the judiciary will be fully guaranteed, and protection and welfare mechanisms will be
introduced to safeguard various groups who may be susceptible to unfair treatment.
˝e NPP believes that Sri Lanka™s underdevelopment and backwardness stem in large part
from being isolated from the global community. We will actively promote ˛elds such as
science and technology, research, education, culture, art, cinema, music, philosophy, and
sports at the state, corporate, and individual levels. A key initiative of the NPP will be
the eˇort to build a uni˛ed Sri Lankan nation. ˝e elite ruling class, which has governed
thecountryuntilnow,failedto unite theSinhalese, Tamil, Muslim,andplantation
communities under one ˆag as a Sri Lankan nation. Instead, they exacerbated conˆicts
between these groups to maintain their power. Our policies outline a range of material,
structural, and operational interventions to address this issue. We will create space for
all ethnicities to envision a shared future as auni˛ed Sri Lankannation. It is our goal
to involve all communities in the processŠfrom designing a production economy to
ensuring fair distribution of its bene˛ts.
We invite all Sri Lankans who aspire to A ˝riving Nation and a Beautiful Life to actively
join the NPP in building a people™s government and collectively implementing our
proposed policy program.

A FULFILLING LIFE

A COMFORTABLE COUNTRY
1.1

A civilized citizen- an advanced human resource
Introduction
E
ducation is a cultural process that generates new knowledge by acquiring and
disseminating existing knowledge. ˝e existence and development of a civilized and
responsiblesociety hinge onthequalityof itseducation. InSriLanka, theeducation system
faces several crises. A major issue is the high dropout rate, with many students leaving
school before completing at least 13 years of education. For example, in 2008, 11.3% of
children who entered the ˛rst year le˙ school before sitting for the GCE O/L examination
in 2018. By 2020, only 64.7% of students who sat for the GCE O/L examination proceeded
totheGCEA/Llevel,meaningthat35.3%ofthosewhoenteredthe˛rstyeardidnotreach
the GCE A/L examination. Only 35.4% of these students passed the GCE A/L examination
and merely 12.7% secured university entrance.
Anothersigni˛cantproblemisthedisparityinthedistributionofhumanandphysical
resources within the school system, which has led to a breakdown in parental trust in the
system. According to the 2022 school census report, out of 10,126 schools, 1,473 (14.5%)
have fewer than 50 students, and 5,204 schools (51.4%) have fewer than 200 students.
˝ismeansthat overhalfof the schools areunderutilizedand lackbasicfacilities.Only
396 schools are classi˛ed as national schools, and just 2,959 schools (29%) oˇer GCE A/L
subject streams. ˝e high cost of education that has to be borne by parents, despite the
policy of free education from the ˛rst year to the ˛rst degree, is another major concern.
Furthermore, serious social criticism exists on the education system™s failure to produce
quality citizens. While education is not solely about preparing individuals for the job
market, it should equip citizens to ful˛l social responsibilities and contribute positively to
the national economy. ˝e current mismatch between the education system and the needs
of the main economic sectors, agriculture, industry, and service, is evident.
˝e NPP™s education policy aims to provide quality education that fosters a developed,
humanistic,and responsible society. To achieve thesegoals, we will increasepublic
investment in the education sector, gradually raising the allocation to education as a
percentage of the gross domestic product up to 6%.

A vigorous life - Healthy people
Introduction
A
ccording to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, health is
a human right. ˝e right to health is intrinsically linked to all other human rights.
Patient empowerment is one of the key elements of patient-centred healthcare. Gender
inequality remains a critical challenge in the health sector. Achieving UniversalHealth
Coverage(UHC)isoneoftheworld™snations™targetswhenadoptingtheSustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). All Sri Lankans have access to the full range of quality health
services they need, when and where they need them, without ˛nancial hardship. It covers
the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention,
treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. ˝erefore, it is the duty of the responsible
government to provide the most e˜cient evidence-based medical care to all citizens
without delay. Quality healthcare systems include patient safety, timeliness, eˇectiveness,
e˜ciency, equity and patient-centeredness. Safety and quality systems are integrated with
governance processes to enable the Ministry of Health to actively manage and improve the
safety and quality of health care for patients.
˝e WHO™s ranking of the world™s health systems indicated that the Sri Lankan health
system was 76 in the year 2000. According to the 2024 edition of the CEOWORLD
magazine™s Health Care Index, Sri Lanka has been ranked as 105 globally. ˝e WHO
recommends that government expenditure on health as a % of GDP should be, at least
5%. Further, a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their expenditure on health
care out of pocket now. WHO further recommends that out-of-pocket expenditure on
health should be less than 20%. But a Sri Lankan family spends more than 50% of their
expenditure on health care out of pocket now. ˝e reforms will require strengthening
all aspects of the health system Œ ˛nancing, human resources, pharmaceuticals, and
information systems Œ to meet the needs of a complex service delivery system.
Principles

A comfortable home - A healthy living

T
hehousingissueinSriLanka,particularlyin urbanareas, hasbecomeincreasingly
severe, especially for low-income families. In Colombo alone, approximately 65,000
homesinlow-incomesettlementsarespreadacross1,000acres.Residentsintheseareas
have been largely neglected by previous governments and suˇer from a lack of basic
amenities such as water, electricity, sanitation, and clean air. While other urban residents
can build, buy, or rent homes, varying income levels make these options challenging for
many. Government employees,in particular, strugglewith the high cost ofrent, as their
incomes are o˙en insu˜cient to cover these expenses.
Rural housing issues also persist, although they have received less attention from the
government. Evenwhenfamiliesownland,they faceproblems suchasunclearland
ownership, poor locations, lack of access roads, high costs of building materials, and
unstable income levels, making it di˜cult to construct or maintain homes. Approximately
2% of Sri Lanka™s rural population lives in estate housing, primarily in the Central, Uva,
Sabaragamuwa, and Southern Provinces. Most of these estate worker communities reside
in overcrowded line houses with minimal facilities. Signi˛cant social issues arise as the
number of households within these communities increases. Despite having land, the low
incomes of these families prevent them from building adequate homes, forcing them to
live under extremely poor conditions.
Our goal is to construct multi-story housing complexes wherever possible, e˜ciently
managing the limited land available and addressing the needs of the people.

A rich cultural life - A compassionate society
Introduction
T
he cultural and artistic space is a highly sensitive area within a society. ˝ough culture
and art seem to take time to have an impact on the human community, the decline
intheseareashascausedasigni˛canterosionincontemporarySriLankansociety.˝e
intentional destruction of the foundation of culture and arts has weakened civil society.
Several past governments have neglected the cultural sector. ˝e educational framework,
which should have been eˇectively developed and maintained from early childhood, has
o˙en fallen victim to shi˙s in political power. As a result, society™s failure to cultivate
a developed cultural life has led individuals to fall short of becoming complete and
empoweredcitizens,evena˙erprogressingthroughstagessuchaspreschool,school,
technical college, and university. ˝isfailure has led to a loss offaith in the belief that
culture is the root of human life.
˝is ˛eld of culture is shaped by the interplay of interconnected domains, including
education, art, media, and religious beliefs. ˝e long-term decline of these areas has given
rise to numerous social issues, such as excessive competition, restlessness, stress, suicides,
dissatisfaction, violence, environmental neglect, and a diminished sense of dignity.
Society is now calling for a new vision that can swi˙ly address these wounds and bring
about essential changes. Such a transformation can only be realized through a robust
revitalization of the cultural sector, aimed at fostering a national revival. ˝e National
People™s Power movement aspires to create a new cultural individual or cultured person
Šone that is free, critical,
respectful of human dignity, and embraces diverse cultures.

Free media industry - An objectively informed society
Introduction
H
uman communication is inherently linked and has evolved over time into a dominant
social process, closely intertwined with modern technology. Mass media represents
the modern state of this long-standing evolution. ˝e term ‚media™ encompasses the
technicalmethods,tools,institutions,technicalprocedures,organizationalstructures,
andotherelementsusedtodisseminatevariousmessagesto thepublic.Itisthemeans
through which broad objectives such as information providing, education, persuasion,
entertainment,socialadaptation,culturalpromotion,andmutualco-existenceare
achieved. ˝e eˇectiveness of journalism relies on the integrity and quality of all these
components.
˝e media process should be tailored to the speci˛c needs of a country, society, or
community. ˝erefore, policies and initiatives that establish its foundation are crucial.
Since gaining independence in 1948, successive governments in Sri Lanka have used print
and electronic media as the mechanism to maintain their power. Consequently, instead
of delivering accurate, truthful, and clear news, the media in the country has increasingly
focused on promoting pro-government narratives, eulogies and personal biases. ˝e
challenge is that news and feature programs ˛lled with deception, misrepresentation, and
biasedattitudeshavefueledmistrust,suspicion,andconˆictamongethnicgroups.As

A safe society - An enriched nation
Introduction
A
pproximately 5.7 million people in Sri Lanka live below the national poverty line (set
at Rs. 16,326 per month as of May 2024 as con˛rmed by the Department of Census and
Statistics. A report published by the United Nations Development Programme indicates
that more than half of the population (55.7%), which is about 12.34 million people, are
exposed to multidimensional poverty. ˝is reˆects a signi˛cant challenge: since gaining
independence, the political parties in power have le˙ a social legacy where a substantial
portion of the population remains poor and suˇers from multidimensional vulnerabilities.
Since independence, every government elected to power has implemented various social
protection and welfare programs aimed at alleviating poverty. While these programs
provide ˛nancial and/or livelihood support to the needy, these programmes suˇer from
several inherent weaknesses, such as ine˜ciency, high administrative costs, lack of
transparency in the selection of bene˛ciaries, failure to reach the intended recipients,
political interference, and delays in payments etc. As a result, successive governments have
failed to provide adequate and strong social protection and welfare to those in need.
˝e NPP views social protection and welfare as a core responsibility of the state. Given
the current economic conditions where a signi˛cant portion of the population lacks
employment, business opportunities, and viable economic prospects, there is a pressing
need for a comprehensive social protection program to rebuild the economy and society.
˝e objective of the NPP™s social protection and welfare programs is to improve the
living standards of those entitled to welfare bene˛ts and to enable them to become active
participantsintheeconomyquickly.Weaspiretoprovideﬁauniversalsocialprotection

Introduction
Human labor is both a key factor of production and a driving force in social development.
However, in modern society, the status and importance that should be accorded to the
worker have been devalued. Despite the critical role that both trained and untrained
workers play in the production process, many workers ˛nd themselves in situations
where they do not receive even a minimum living wage. As a result, most of the labor
force faces harsh experiences in their economic, social, and cultural lives. ˝e goal of this
initiative is to establish a system where labor is respected and valued appropriately, by
fosteringhumane employer-employee relationships thatensure equalityand recognition
for workers of all levels.

Impartial Human Identity

Gender Equality in social-life
Introduction
A
lthough women are an integral part of society, they consistently occupy an unequal
position due to marginalization within major socio-economic, cultural, and political
systems. ˝is inequality occurs across all sectors, including the home, community,
workplace, and politics. In recent decades, the situation has worsened due to neoliberal
economic policies. Despite women being the primary earners of foreign remittances, the
necessary structural and ideological changes for equality and justice have not yet taken
place. Instead, the commodi˛cation of women™s identities and their marginalization in the
labor market have intensi˛ed.
Overall, factors such as the marginalization of both women and men as vulnerable workers,
the direct impact on women due to the weakening of public services like education and
healthcare, and the enactment of laws controlling women™s bodies amidst militarization
and ethno-religious extremism highlight women™s issues as a broader social crisis.
˝erefore, the current issues faced by women in Sri Lanka must be understood through
an intersectionalperspective.˝eNPP proposes a politicalpracticethat represents
allmarginalizedgroupsinsociety,aimingtorealizetheaspirationsofajustsociety,a
free country, and free women by securing all rights. Hence, its policies on women are
intrinsically linked to its other policies.
Gender identities and sexual orientations are diverse. However, in Sri Lanka, these groups
o˙en face violence, marginalization, and stigmatization. Additionally, outdated colonial
laws, institutional frameworks, and regressive cultural beliefs contribute to the denial of
justice to these communities. In a just society that treats everyone equally, no group should
be marginalized because of their gender identity or sexual orientation.
Principles
˘

Economic justice as a cornerstone for achieving gender equality.
˘

State policies acknowledging the value of unpaid care work within the national
economy.

A safe world for children

A creative future generation
Introduction
B
y 2023, Sri Lanka™s population was 22,037,000 and 6,642,331, which is 30.14% of the
totalpopulation,were childrenunder 18years of age, according to the de˛nitionof
the United Nations. Today, children face signi˛cant issues such as weak justice systems,
inadequateprotectionservices,educationalchallenges,andmalnutrition.˝ejudicial
process for children who fall victim to crimes o˙en drags on for excessively long periods,
sometimes extending even 6 to 10 years.
Currently, the Department of Prisons transports children to and from court alongside
adult oˇenders, endangering their safety and privacy. Decades-old laws like the Vagrants
Ordinance, which has been in force since colonization, continue to infringe on individuals™
freedom of movement, violating the rights of children and their families. A comprehensive
review of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, which has undergone only minor
amendments over the decades, is also necessary.
Educationiscrucialindevelopingtheskillsandmindsetneededforchildren™ssuccessin
arapidlychangingworld,butSriLanka™scurrenteducationsystemisfailingtomeetthis
need. ˝e frustrations and lack of trust in the future caused by corruption and bribery in
the country have driven many young people to seek opportunities abroad.
˝e absence of a well-organized and adequate human and physically resourceful social
service system in Sri Lanka has made child welfare a signi˛cant challenge. Although
˛eld o˜cers are assigned to social protection and related duties, gaps in identifying and
assisting at-risk children and families have weakened the services. ˝e NPP™s policy on

children in Sri Lanka through increased budget allocations, improved health and safety
measures, legal reforms, and advancement of education.

A contented Youth Œ Cultured, Independent Thinkers
Introduction
I
n Sri Lanka, 38% of the total population, that is approximately 8.5 million individuals
belong to young generation. Since the independence, youth in Sri Lanka have experienced
unsatisfactory lives. Particularly over the last seven decades, the prevailing political system
and culture have prevented them from eˇective political participation. ˝e three major
uprisingsin theNorth and Southin recentdecades,during whichhundreds ofthousands
ofyoung peoplelosttheirlives,were drivenbytheunful˛lleddreamsofayouththat the
political establishment failed to satisfy.
Contributing factors to this discontent includelimitededucationalopportunities,
restricted access to economic participation, insu˜cient opportunities for youth to engage
in technological and communication advancements, the inability to live asequal members
of society without being subjected to external pressures, and the lack of means to live
with dignity and respect. ˝e massive youth-led people™s struggle of 2022, which arose
against economic hardship is one that extended beyond mere economic demands to call
for a systemic change within the country. However, the core objectives of this movement
were not achieved. All this highlight that the youth has represented and still represent a
marginalized and overlooked group, despitebeing themost capableand powerfulforce
that could contribute to the future development of the country.

A respectable senior citizen- A meaningful retirement
Introduction
T
aking care of the elderly is a responsibility of the children and relatives within a family
and is a cultural value. ˝e elderly, who havecontributed to thesocio-economic
development of their families and communities for most of their lives, deserve care and
attention during their later years. In 2023, the population of senior citizens in Sri Lanka
(those aged 60 and above) was 3.7 million, representing 17.2% of the total population.
By 2045, this percentage is projected to rise to 21%. While some policymakers view
the increasing elderly population as a challenge, the NPP believes that it is a national
responsibility to understand and address this situation with special attention to the well-
being of the elderly.

A modern life

A wealthy nation

Introduction
T
he quality of life and socio-cultural development of citizens of a country depends
on correct economic policies adopted and actions taken. ˝e destructive economic
policies and corrupt political culture followed by the leaders of the country have le˙ us
today with a battered and crippled economy and society where human lives have been
shattered in every aspect.
˝e total government debt, Rs. 310,779 million in 1990, increased to Rs. 28,695,950
million by 2023, pushing the entire nation into a debt trap. Between 2015 and 2019 alone,
the total debt increased by Rs. 13,031,543 million, reˆecting a 74% increase. Additionally,
therewasastaggeringdebtgrowthof51.43%in2022comparedto2021.AsofMarch
31, 2024, the total public debt has reached Rs. 28,013,560 million, which exceeded USD
100,000 million.
However, due to the misappropriation of borrowed funds and the failure to invest them
in economically productive projects, the economy did not grow in corresponding to the
increasein debt. ˝e annual economicgrowth decreased from5% to -0.2%between2015
and 2019 and it was -2.3% in 2023.
Weak tax administration, ine˜ciency, corruption, granting tax bene˛ts to cronies, tax
avoidance, and tax evasion have led to a signi˛cant decline in government tax revenue
as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By December 2023, the total
taxdefaultsaloneexceededRs.1,100,000million.˝egovernment™sstancehasbeento
impose more taxes on people, cut essential public expenditure, and sell oˇ public assets
without considering the negative consequences of the decline in the demand for goods
and services and the disposable income of people.
Despite continued rhetoric about controlling inˆation, the reality is that the prices of
goods and services have risen to unaˇordable levels. ˝e ultimate result is that people™s
real income has gone down so low that basic human needs cannot be ful˛lled. As a result
of destructive politics, about 26% of the population has been dragged below the poverty
line.
˝e external sector of the economy also continues to weaken due to the arbitrary use of
foreign reserves, weak foreign exchange management, the inability to re˛nance foreign
debt caused by the continuous downgrading of the credit rating of the country, the inability
toattractforeigninvestment,risingimportexpenditure,andstagnantexportearnings.
Even foreign reserves at the end of May 2024 stood at USD 5.4 billion (including USD
1.5 billion SWAP loan facilities provided by the People™s Bank of China), it was mainly an
outcome of unpaid interest, debt instalments in arrears, import restrictions, remittances
from overseas Sri Lankans, and receipt of IMF extended fund facility, rather than a result
of proactive and sustainable measures of the government.
56
Inequality in income distribution has also been widening. ˝e bottom 20% of households
receive only 4.6% of the national income, while the top 20% get 51.4% of the income.
˝e NPP™s economic policy framework focuses on economic democracy and is integrated
with a human resource development plan and a technological development roadmap
to ensure equitable opportunities in economic activities, participation in the economic
decision making process with an equal say, and a fair share of economic bene˛ts, has
been developed based on ten key principles to achieve sustainable economic growth and
development, aiming a RealGDP target of USD 120 billion by 2030 through a resilient
production economy.
In formulating these policies, factors such as resource availability and accessibility, outcomes
of research and development activities, socially embedded knowledge, civilization process,
biodiversity, technology, strategic location of the country and the nature of diplomatic
relations have been considered.

High productivity - Nation with food security
Introduction
C
urrently,the agriculturalsectorcontributes8.4% to GDP,while employment inthis
sector accounts for approximately 27%. Additionally, 15.3% of export revenue is
generated from agricultural crops. ˝is highlights the signi˛cant role agriculture plays in
Sri Lankan society.
With rapid population growth, traditional technologies alone became insu˜cient to
produce the required amount of food for the population, prompting Sri Lanka to adopt
modern technological methods. ˝ese eˇorts enabled the country to meet the target of
producing 2.4 million metric tons of rice necessary for the population. However, some
shortsighted policies implemented during past administrations have challenged domestic
rice production. Farmers struggle to receive a fair price for their harvests, while consumers
˛nd purchasing preferred rice varieties at aˇordable prices di˜cult.
Increasing the production of high-quality vegetables and fruits has become a challenge,
with approximately 30% of the total vegetable and fruit production being lost post-
harvest. Looking at the other ˛eld crop sector, the country spent about USD 400 million
on imports in 2022 alone. Additionally, the production of foreign exchange-earning crops
such as tea, coconut, rubber, export-oriented crops, and specialty crops has declined. ˝e
wrong agricultural policies and actions of past governments, along with the failure to
adopt appropriate technologies, have contributed to these issues.
As a result, the current agriculture sector in Sri Lanka faces several major challenges,
including subsistence farming, minimal mechanization, high production costs, insu˜cient
prices for production, high prices and price volatility of agricultural products, weak
extension services, inadequate value addition, and low youth participation. ˝is agricultural

High-quality livestock production - An entrepreneurial

approach
Introduction
T
he livestock sector plays a vital role in providing essential proteins and other nutrients
to the people of Sri Lanka. Additionally, it signi˛cantly strengthens the national
economy and improves livelihoods through import substitution. ˝e sustainability of the
livestock industry depends on factors such as production capacity, the number of livestock
farms, infrastructure, the labour force, and the availability of policymakers, administrators,
researchers, and other stakeholders.
However, livestock production in Sri Lanka has not yet reached the desired levels, and
thesectorfacesnumerouschallenges.˝eseincludesevereshortagesofqualityanimal
food and breeding materials, high prevalence of animal diseases, weak supply chains and
services related to production, unethical and imbalanced markets, lack of organized value
chain developments and proper livestock extension programs, inadequate health services,
poor management of breeding activities, minimal research interventions, limited access to
credit and insurance facilities, and insu˜cient incentives and guidance for stakeholders.

Introduction
T
he need for protein has been identi˛ed as a major component in human nutrition,
with˛shand related productsrecognized asahigh-quality,safe sourceofprotein.
˝erefore, it is a national priority to strengthen ˛sheries and aquaculture to meet the
country™s demand for˛sh. Fisheries, aquaculture, and related industriescan also contribute

socio-economic status of people, and earning foreign exchange.
˝e˛sheriesinSriLankacanbedividedintomaincategories:seawater˛sheries
and freshwater ˛sheries and the aquaculture industry. ˝e ocean region of Sri Lanka
encompasses a unique economic zone of 517,000 square kilometers. It also consists of
a local waterbody of 21,500 square kilometers, lagoons and estuaries covering1,580
square kilometers, and reservoirs spanning 5,200 square kilometers. Currently, around
225,000 individuals in Sri Lanka engage in seawater ˛sheries, while approximately 90,650
are involved in freshwater ˛sheries. In the year 2000 the ˛sheries and related industries
contributed 2.7%. to the country™s GDP. But this has now decreased to 1.2%. Our annual
per capita ˛sh consumption, which was 17.2 kilograms in 2017, has now declined to 11.07
kilograms. ˝is trend has adversely aˇected the health of people, especially children and
pregnant mothers.
˝e˛sheriesandaquaculturesectorsarecurrentlyfacingmanyissues.Amongthem,the
high expenditure on fuel and other resources, the government™s lack of interventions to
introducebettertechnology and techniques,illegal˛shingactivitiesby foreign vessels,
an outdated legal framework and processes, and insu˜cient incentives for sustainable
and eco-friendly techniques are the primary concerns. ˝e main aims of this policy

ri Lanka has a skilled workforce comprising educated and trainable professionals. ˝e
country™s strategic location makes it a hub for oˇering services to Asian, European,
Middle Eastern, and African nations. However, subject ˛elds in Sri Lanka™s education
system are evolving too slowly to meet the global IT industry™s demands, leading to a skill
gap. Additionally, investment opportunities to launch modern Research and Development
(R&D) and Technology sectors are limited. High energy costs, uncertainty in supply, weak
internet infrastructure, insu˜cient public transportation, and unstable state policies and
economic conditions further hinder industry growth.
˝e global ICT market, valued at USD 9,039 billion in 2024, is rapidly expanding, with
a projected growth rate of 11.0% by 2028, presenting signi˛cant opportunities for Sri

esearchanddevelopment(R&D)combinedwithscienceandtechnologyproduces
value-added products and services, upli˙ing the country™s economy, and supporting
human and social development. Sri Lanka allocates only the limited amount of 0.12% of
itsannualGDPforresearchanddevelopment,whilecountrieswithsimilargeo-political

Meanwhile South Korea allocates 4.6%, Japan 3.6%, USA 3.5%, and China 3%, becoming
75
developed countries. Even the limited research conducted in Sri Lanka have not been used
properly for economic and social development.
Sri Lanka possesses many resources, including endemic ˆora and fauna species with
high biodiversity and herbal value, geological resources, the sea surrounding the island,
freshwater resources within the country, balanced soil, tropical climate, year-round solar
power, wind power, and rivers and lakes with much potential. All these elements can be
used to produce value-added products and services with lower costs, giving higher pro˛ts,
and they carry a huge potential in the international market.
Sri Lanka is rich with intelligent human resources, and many innovators are emerging even
at the village level, but a mechanism to extract their ideas and innovations or to provide
the necessary infrastructure occurred at a minimum level. In the future, Sri Lanka can be
turned into an innovation centre by providing resources and the correct environment to
harness this human potential. ˝e state and private sector should support with a correct

An entrepreneurship explosion - An organic approach
Introduction
I
n comparison to other developing nations, Sri Lanka has not been able to reach its
potential in industrial development when compared to countries like Bangladesh,
Vietnam, and South Korea who have signi˛cantly expanded their share of the global
product and service market by consistently growing their gross domestic products (GDP).
In 2023, the GDPs of Bangladesh, Vietnam, and South Korea reached USD 460 billion,
USD 409 billion, and USD 1,700 billion, respectively, while Sri Lanka™s GDP was only USD
84 billion. Moreover, these countries generated export revenues of USD 59 billion, USD
384billion,andUSD808billion,respectively,whereasSriLanka™smerchandiseexport
revenue was just USD 17.3 billion. ˝is disparity highlights Sri Lanka™s critical challenge
in goods and services production, which stems from the lack of a comprehensive plan to
enhance production capabilities and the failure to leverage advanced global technologies
for productive growth.

A sustainable resource utilization - Generation of the

Introduction
S
ri Lanka has an abundance of mineral resources, accumulated throughout the land
space of 65,610 square kilometers. ˝e peninsular basin, which is about twenty times
theland area and including theocean region which willbe nominally grantedaccording
to the UN ocean laws, is also rich in ocean minerals. Varieties of ores of minerals such as
graphite, mica, apatite, lime and dolomite, mineral sand, quartz and silica sand, feldspar,
serpentine, laterite, diˇerent clay types, and gems which had been created because of
diˇerent geological factors are abundantly found in Sri Lanka. Many industries such as
mineral sand, cement, phosphate, ceramic, glass, and roof tiles wereoriginated from
mineral resources discovered through the mineral resource expeditions in the 1980s.
Since then, minerals have been sold as raw material without any value additions, and
many of these industries have either been sold out or closed by now.
Sri Lanka has been famous since ancient times as a country abundant with variety of
gems. ˝ere is an immense potential to make Sri Lanka a main centre in the global gem
market by capturing a considerable portion of the global gem market using the presence
ofindividualswhopossessbothtraditionalandmoderntechnologiesaboutthegem
industry, the availability of university-level programmes, and the unique location of Sri
Lanka. However, Sri Lanka hasbeen able toearn only USD 250million a year from the
gem and jewelry industry. Issues such as the lack of state sponsorship to the industry, laws
and regulations not being updated, corruption and bribery due to political interventions,
o˜cials not possessing enough knowledge on the ˛eld, and the absence of proper lab
facilities and a systematic evaluation mechanism are main reasonings for this situation.
˝ere is an ability to start industries that can provide a considerable support to the national
economy using lime, calcite and dolomite, mineral sand and quarts, and silica which
possess graphite, apatite, calcium carbonate. ˝ere are possibilities to develop industries
based on valueadded products fromoresthat containiron and copper, as wellas other
small mineral ores discovered so far. Moreover, mineral resources on land and seabed can
bediscovered and their mineral oresand rare earth elements (REE)can beused toearn
foreign exchange.

A secured energy centre - A sustainable revenue source
Introduction
˝e global energy ˛eld is passing a transformative era with sustainability and innovation,
adjusting to constantly evolving customer needs and regulation frameworks. New energy
methods such as solar power, wind power, and energy storing systems are achieving a
rapid development due to the global aim of reducing greenhouse emissions and the need
toreducecost.Further,technologywithlowharmfulemissionssuchasgreenhydrogen
and small-scale nuclear power plants are coming forward. ˝e cost of producing batteries
is rapidly reducing, and the global transportation ˛eld is rapidly becoming electri˛ed.
Total electri˛cation of energy consumption is a method of achieving zero emission goals.
Fossil fuel continues to ful˛ll a considerable role in meeting global energy demands, and
91
a global discourse has come up which urges the minimization of the harm it has on the
environment. It is also important to maintain a strategic mixture of energy towards energy
protection amidst geo-political conˆicts and disagreements. In this case much attention
has been directed towards natural gas as an interim step in transitioning towards renewable
energy. International investments are expanding towards broadening the exploration and
production of new gas resources and infrastructure for LNG.
While the trends remain such, Sri Lanka stands high up in the list of countries in the region
with the highest electricity costs. It is this unbearable energy expenditure which stays a
mainhindranceintakingthecountryoutofthepitofeconomiccollapseduetodecades
of wrong economic management. ˝e main factor for the electricity cost to remain high
is the high cost of generation due to the strong dependency on petroleum products.A
reasonofthisistheconstructionofhigh-costpowerplantssuchasthosewhichrunon
diesel by the former governments instead of investing in low-cost power plants in time.
Taking the energy mix towards a green economy through renewable sources, by
strategicallyreducingits dependence onpetroleumoils,willprovide solutions to thebasic
problems. It is the aim of the National People™s Power to turn Sri Lanka™s energy system
into a competitive and transparent one, empowering the customers and equipped with
the latest technology. Whilst saving our environment for the future generations, the NPP
hopes to consider energy as an important part of the mission to capture an appropriate
portion of the world manufactured products market.

A good public transportation service

Introduction
U
nsystematic and ine˜cient transport has wasted a considerable amount of time of
most of the public. Heavy tra˜c, wasting a lot of time on the road, transport services
not working at night, too many road accidents, and sexual and other harassment faced by
women and children in public services characterises our passenger transport service. ˝e
reporting of around 30,000 road accidents a year is an indication of the lack of safety and
its intensity in the transport sector. ˝e contribution of the railway service has dropped to
5%inthetransportsector.˝eportionoftheSLTBinbuspassengerservicehasdropped
to 14%. Around 55% of the citizens opt to use private vehicles to ful˛l their transport
needs due to the decline in public transport, and they have to spend a large amount of
their income on transport as a result. It has also resulted in high road tra˜c.
88,200kmoftheentire119,382kmroadnetworkofSriLankabelongstolocalgovernment
institutes, and many roads at the rural and semi-urban areas are in a dilapidated state due
tolackofmaintenance.Alargeamountofmoneyˆowsoutannuallytoimportfuel,and
around 65% of the fuel burned in the country are spent in the transport sector. It thereby
contributed to half of the air pollution. Further, around 35% of fruits and vegetables go
into waste due to unsatisfactory transportation.
National People™s Power wishes to establish an e˜cient, trustworthy, safe, and digni˛ed
people-oriented transport service with the long-term vision to gradually transform it into
an eco-friendly system. Hence the goal is to provide 70% of the public™s transport needs
through public transportation within 5 years.

A sustainable marine resource - Acquiring a portion of

global maritime business
Introduction
S
ri Lanka plays a big role in the global nautical ˛eld based on its strategic location at a
centrewhereEasternand Western sea routesmeet.Yearly,thousands oftonsof goods
are transported by ships that sail past our country. ˝e Colombo Harbour is located at
an ideal spot to conduct this sea transportation, while the Hambantota Harbour, located
in the South, operates much lower than its capacity. ˝ere is potential to develop the
Colombo and Hambantota ports as two of the biggest naval centres in the world by
attracting a considerable portion of the global maritime industry, providing competitive
services and investing in infrastructure. ˝e main ports of Colombo, Galle, Hambantota,
and Trincomalee greatly contribute to the country™s business and economic development
and aˇect a large portion of the country™s market.
Sri Lanka™s sailors hold world fame for their excellence, skill, and performance, and they
are a main resource in our nautical ˛eld. ˝ere is a considerable potential to earn foreign
exchange and create job opportunities with high bene˛t for the country™s youth, through
the development of the number of professional sailors in Sri Lanka. ˝is proposed policy
framework brings balanced access to the development of the industry and the contribution
of diˇerent stakeholders, including the harbour, nautical companies, and specialists, to
bringSriLankatotheforefrontof the globalnautical ˛eld. WehopetomakeSriLanka

A productive land management system

Integrated control plan
Introduction

A
ccording to the Land Commissioner Department, 82% of Sri Lanka™s total land area,
which stands at 6.6 million hectares, belongs to the government, while the remaining
18%,amountingto1.2millionhectares,isprivateland.32%ofthe5.4millionhectares
that belong to the state, which is 1.7 million hectares, are forests. In general, lands have
been categorized as agricultural, commercial, or residential according to their usage for
ease of administration and management.
˝e ordinances and regulations imposed during the colonial period to control land resources
have made a signi˛cant impact on land management in Sri Lanka. ˝e governments a˙er
the independence did not make any special eˇort to scienti˛cally amend these laws for the
well-being of the country and its people. Instead, some land reforms and policies aimed
at land distribution, driven by narrow intentions, have contributed to socio-economic
inequality. Issues related to land ownership have remained unresolved for a long time,
leading to various social disparities.

Introduction
T
he development and sustenance of the construction industry, which reˆects
the country™s economic development, depend on state and private investment
in infrastructure and projects. Before the 2022 downfall, the construction industry
contributed 7% to the country™s GDP and provided direct and indirect employment to
over 1 million individuals. Despite the recent crisis, the industry has the potential for
signi˛cant growth with the right investments and strategies.
Currently, mostofthe constructorsandadvisors inthe ˛eldare fromthe privatesector,
andtheconstructioncompaniesownedbythegovernmentshowlessperformancedueto
interventions and ine˜cient control.
Shortcomings in the procurement process, ine˜ciency, weak project management
practices, political interventions, corruption, and the implementation of projects without
proper ˛nancial support pose considerable challenges to the industry™s stability. ˝ese
issues hinder the performance of the construction projects, resulting in delays, excessive
costs,andlow-qualityproducts.Further,outdatedplanningmethodsandstandards,the
inability to use new project management methods, and the lack of trained professionals
negatively aˇect the industry. Job security and worker welfare in this ˛eld are not favourable.
Due to a lack of low-cost raw materials, new technological innovations, and limited
investments in research and development, the industry has achieved only a tiny portion
in the international arena. Further, brain drain has aˇected the industry™s lack of trained
labour, daily operations, and development.
Pastgovernmentsinvestedloansfromlocalbanksandtwo-partyandmulti-partyloansin
construction projects, and the lack of bene˛ts from these projects contributed greatly to
the country™s loan crisis.

Introduction

S
ri Lanka™s public service is the main instrument that implements state policies. ˝e
Sri Lankan government service, which consists of a 1.4 million workforce, consists of
diˇerent professionals and o˜cers from ministry secretaries to o˜ce support staˇ, and
the state spends a considerable portion of its income on maintaining it. Even though it
consists of o˜cers with diˇerent educational and professional levels possessing other
skills, at present, the government service has become ine˜cient, failing to ful˛l public
expectations and losing public faith.

olice plays a very important role in maintaining law and order in the country as an
institution close to the public. An important factor that reˆects how the rule of law

Introduction
T
he vision of the Prisons Department in Sri Lanka is to social reintegration of inmates
as good citizens through rehabilitation. But in the recent past, incidents of killing and
inhumane torture of prisoners in various prisons show that people who are imprisoned
face diˇerent forms of abuse. Also, there is a public opinion that powerful prisoners with
certain political connections enjoy special privileges.
ﬁPrisoners are also humanﬂ is only limited to a theme at present, and overcrowding and
lack of basic facilities for prisoners are serious problems faced by prisons. ˝e prison
has become a place to punish prisoners rather than to reform them. Prisons at present
have become criminal centres due to drug tra˜cking and underworld activities and have
hindered the people who are serving their prison life with good behaviour.
˝e increase in the remand prisoner population is a major cause of prison overcrowding
due to the long time it takes to complete legal proceedings. In 2022, there were 108,250
remand prisoners, 30,331 convicted prisoners, and a total of 138,581 prisoners living in
prisons. Men show a higher tendency to be imprisoned than women, and the percentage
of women among the total number of prisoners in 2022 was 3.23%. 19,094 or 62.95% of
convicted prisoners were convicted of drug related charges. Further, 92% of the convicted
prisoners had been educated up to G.E.C. O/L exam or less, while 62% were under 40.
Although it is the expectation of the National People™s Power to create a social environment
where people are not inclined to do crimes, we consider the welfare of the people serving
prison sentences for any reason to be the responsibility of the government.
Principles
Ł

Guardianship and protection
Ł

Rehabilitation and re-socializing
ACTIVITIES
Ł

Preventing all forms of torture inside prisons
Ł

incarceration

prisoners

A drug-free country - A healthier citizen life
Introduction
A
t present, drug use has become a social problem due to its rapid rise. Drug use has
caused many serious problems in the family as well as in society. ˝e tendency of
schoolchildren to get addicted to drugs has increased.
˝e current regime has failed to control the importation and distribution of drugs into the
country, and jailing drug users alone is not adequate to curbing this menace. Currently,
drug use has created a social tragedy and in 2022, 152,979 people were arrested for
drug oˇences. However,only 1930 peopleamong these were referred to rehabilitation
programmes. About 60% of the oˇenders who go to prison are in prison for drug-
related oˇences. Sri Lanka has become a hub for drug tra˜cking in the region, under the
protection of political and other forces, which has contributed to the growth of organized
crime. ˝erefore, the National People™s Power prioritizes drug prevention.
Activities
Ł

An integrated operation to prevent drugs and organized crime in the country
Ł

Establishment of a separate Bureau for Narcotics Prevention
Ł

Development of naval and air surveillance facilities and provide modern
equipment and training to o˜cials to prevent the entry of drugs into the country

Introduction
S
ri Lanka™s strategic location at the center of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal has
deep rooted historical antecedents. Archeological evidence provides ample materials
to establish that Sri Lanka has had vibrant trade relations across the Bay of Bengal and
with Southeast Asia. Sri Lanka™s geostrategic location within the Indian Ocean is a blessing
as the islandis astrideone of theworld™s busiestsealanes ofcommunication thatconnect
East and West.
Developing Asia will be the world™s largest region in terms of population. ˝e region™s
share of world GDP will reach 30.5%, and Asia will essentially be a middle-income region
by 2025. Sri Lanka has a history of leadership in foreign policy, grounded in the principle
of non-alignment.
For the mutual growth along with the other countries of the region as well as for the
National Security Foreign Policy play a crucial role. Factors that inˆuence any State™s
foreign policy choices are geographical location, population, history, economic resources,
ideology, government e˜ciency, quality of diplomacy, crisis and immediate events,
technologicaladvancements,internationallawandinstitutions,etc.However,wehave
observed in the recent past that the determinant of the foreign policy in Sri Lanka has
mainly inˆuenced by external factors and survival choices of ruling parties rather than
the best interest of Sri Lankans. National interests should be the cornerstone of the foreign
policy. Foreign policy reˆectsnationalinterestsand oˇers aperspectiveon humanand
global interests of a particular State.
When the current situation of Sri Lanka is considered, we are passing a period of worst
economiccrisis.Oneofthemostimportantnationalinterestsofoursistogradually
withdraw from the debt crisis. Further domestic policy is formulated to protect and
promote the national interest domestically within the country. A country™s foreign policy
is designed based on national strategy to protect and promote the national interests.
Foreignanddomesticpoliciesareintertwined moreclosely thaneverbefore.SriLanka™s
current foreign relations are inˆuenced signi˛cantly by attempts to recover from the worst
economiccrisisin2022andstandsasachallengeweshouldovercome. Risinggeopolitical
tension among international and regional powers in our region has become a key challenge
to Sri Lanka™s security and regional stability.
However, its geographical location as well as Sri Lanka™s long invested diplomatic and
cultural assets will become cornerstone our success. Comparatively higher human
117
development indicators such as the level of education and health, education of women,
etc.. than other south Asian countries have provided Sri Lanka a relatively positive cultural
level of the population which will be a pro factor for achieving ambitious Economic and
foreign policy targets also.
Sri Lanka has important diplomatic recognition earned through some wise and correct
actions of the past. For instance, Sri Lanka has been a traditional friend of oppressed and
colonized nations in the world and Sri Lanka has always supported their independence.
Number of those countries are now not only independent but also has become major
regional powers. Sri Lanka has been standing right side of the history promoting peace,
sovereignty of the nations in various international issues. Sri Lanka has never supported
any international war a˙er its independence. Sri Lanka has a good name among many
nations for its principled positions. ˝eseprecious diplomatic assets shouldbe employed
to achieve the new challenges of the country. Sri Lanka must regain her position as an
