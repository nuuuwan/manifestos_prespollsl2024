My fellow Sri Lankans,
As weapproach adefining moment in our nation‚Ñ¢spolitical journeywith the
forthcoming Presidential election, I, Sajith Premadasa, proudly present this
manifesto (Win for all), on behalf of the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS) to outline
our vision for a positive national transformation.
The SJS is a new political force, with a vision to create a new Sri Lanka, by introducing
a social market economy with social justice at its core. We believe a true democracy
is one in which every citizen‚Ñ¢s voice is heard.
Therefore, ourmanifesto &economic visionis not justabout statisticalgrowth but
about tangible prosperity in every segment of society. We will create a resilient
and inclusive economy, combining the strength of free markets with a deep

Another crucial pillar of our vision is the fight against corruption. Corruption has
long been a stain on Sri Lanka and has ultimately led us to bankruptcy, undermining
trust in government and robbing our citizens. The future SJS government will root
out corruption by embedding transparency and accountability in every aspect of
governance with the necessary system reforms.
Inourpursuitofprosperity,specialattentionwillbeprovidedtothecrucial

be reinforced with professional and technological resources to create a healthy
nation. The education sector will be revamped to build internationally competitive
human capital, which can thrive in a rapidly changing world while contributing to
the growth of Sri Lanka.
Throughout history, nations have been developed with strong team leadership.
This is why the SJS has assembled the most qualified and pragmatic, team of
politicians to ensure that the ambitious goals in this manifesto are achieved.

BUILD A
RESILIENT

ECONOMY
We prioritize equitable growth
through a Social Market Economy
model, ensuring that the benefits of
development reach all citizens. As
we chart a course toward economic
recovery and lasting prosperity, we
pledge transparency, sustainability
and empowerment creating a future
where all can thrive.
9
Sri Lanka is still facing its most severe
economic crisis to date, caused by heavy
debt, poor policy decisions, and weak
governance. While recent steps have helped
by lowering inflation and boosting foreign
reserves, the road to full recovery and
becoming an advanced economy remains
extremely challenging. The average Sri
Lankan has been forced to bear the brunt
of the crisis, struggling with high prices and
increased taxes and hopelessness.
We will follow a Social Market Economy
model guided by Social Democratic Political
Principles to foster equitable and inclusive
growth, harnessing the power of markets
while ensuring social justice and protection
for all. Our Blueprint 3.0 provides a strategic
plantotacklethese challenges,rebuildthe
economy through strong growth, and secure
a prosperous future for all. A key part of this
plan is erasing corruption, a necessary but

a green economy and environmental
sustainabilityas foundational principlesfor
economic growth and development.
To achieve sustainable growth, we need a
two-part approach: First, we must reform
the economy to make it more competitive
and globally connected. This will create
wealth among the people. Second, we
need to ensure economic justice and equity
through a strong social safety net with
targeted subsidies to protect the vulnerable.
Additionally, we will aim to increase Gross
National Happiness (GNH) by fostering a
society where economic progress goes hand
inhandwiththewell-being andoverall
happiness of our citizens.
TRANSPARENCY AND

ACCOUNTABILITY
Introducing strong anti-corruption laws
and strengthening the implementation
of the current legal framework will speed
up justice. The recovery of stolen assets
and a robust programme to curb rampant
corruptioninthecountry‚Ñ¢s administrative
system shall be key. Establishing an
w
of political interference to bring to justice
corrupt individuals will be done on an urgent
basis by a simple amendment to legislation.
We will enact a Public Procurement Law to
guarantee procurement is conducted in a

manner. All government procurement shall
be transferred to a digital platform.
To provide the consumer with the best
quality and price, monopolistic and
oligopolisticbehaviorwill becorrected
through the immediate introduction of a
competition law.
We will bring in transparency in public
finance management. There shall be full
disclosure on expenditure plans and debt
managementstrategiesaswellasintax
administration. The establishment of

henceforth provide detailed analysis of all
government tax and expenditure proposals.
MANAGING THE DEBT
CRISIS AND THE IMF
We will strengthen fiscal discipline as per the

butnecessaryreformsto meetthetargets
of revenue, primary balance and debt.
However, we will make amendments to
the current programme to guarantee relief
to those below poverty line and improve
quality of life for Sri Lankans.
In the case of agreeing to a solution that
allows for ‚Äöclaw back‚Ñ¢ clauses for foreign
creditors to benefit from more than
expected GDP growth, we will insist that
‚Äöcomparability of treatment‚Ñ¢ be extended to
the EPF that bore the brunt of the domestic
debt restructure.
10
MONETARY AND

EXCHANGE RATE
POLICY
We will respect the autonomy of the Central
Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) provided by the
new Act but holdthe bank fully accountable
for meeting its inflation target. Furthermore,
we will help ensure low and stable interest
rates, an internationally competitive foreign
exchange rate..
ACHIEVING A
REVENUE GROWTH
Thesolutionto increase government
revenue is not confined to raising taxes. One
of our first acts will be to introduce digital
technology to increase revenue, minimize
expenditure and corruption. We will revise
the unfair burden sharing structure of the
IMF supported tax code revision that is
forcingprofessionals toseekemployment
abroad.
Somehighlightsof ourrevisedstructurethat
will not disturb the overall revenue targets
but will reduce the heavy burden on middle-
class are:

Personal income tax: Personal income

per month will start at just 1% and
increase up to 24% income up to around

current rates will apply for high income
earners.

Corporate income tax: We intend
reducing up to 6% from the present 30%
rateforprofits onexportsandintroduce

(BEPS) minimum alternate tax for
multinational companies.

VAT: We intend to reduce VAT to 15%
once tax compliance improves through
the use of Public Digital Infrastructure to
widening the tax net. Certain identified
items in addition to essential food as
consumables and inputs shall be made
zero rated for VAT.

Excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol and
taxes on casinos will be adjusted to fund
tax reductions.

Aguaranteedupto15%savings interest
rate will be provided for senior citizen
savings.
EXPENDITURE
CONTROL
Although the IMF programme has focused
on increasing revenue, it has not adequately
addressed government expenditure control.
Therefore, our economic vision aims to
control wasteful government spending and
corruption. This includes reforming state
enterprises. Funds so saved will be utilized
to implement a social safety net for the
distressed population and to strengthen
education and health sectors.
We will use data-based planning to control
government expenditure and strengthen
transparency and accountability of
government spending to increase public
trust.
STIMULATING
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Our government will be committed to
transforming Sri Lanka into a globally
connected social market economy, with
private enterprise, both large and small,
as the principal driver of growth. This
transformation requires two key actions:
enhancing global economic integration
through trade liberalization and foreign
directinvestmentand unshacklingdomestic
markets, including product and labor
¬Ø
will enable full private sector engagement in
national development.
11

AGRICULTURAL REFORMS
We
shall address challenges at multiple
levels. Archaic laws need modernization.
Reformswill unshackleagriculturemarkets,
provide equitable water access through

from obtaining information on what, how
much,andwhento produce,tofinancing
inputs and managing the cultivation cycle≈†
‚ÅÑ
harvest management in terms of storage to
logistics to sale must be addressed.
We will implement a rapid,

smart technology-drivenagricultural
modernization programme to reduce rural
poverty, increase productivity, and promote
sectorgrowth. This includesinterventions
≈í in paddy, vegetable, and plantation crops
≈í from planting to sale, like protected

andperhaps even AI-assistedhydroponic
¬Ø
with the launching of the Digital Public
Infrastructure (DPI).
To reduce andmaintain the price ofrice
we will reintroduce the ‚ÄöShakthi‚Ñ¢ rice miller
nation-wide cooperative programme. We will
also immediately establish ‚ÄöPrabhashwara‚Ñ¢,
anetworkof climate-controlledagricultural
produce warehouses around the country to
reducethe40%post-harvestlossofproduce.
This too will contribute to lowering the price
of food.

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT:
CONNECTING TO THE GLOBAL
VALUE CHAIN
Sri Lanka will be connected to Global
Manufacturing Value Chains (GMVCs) starting
with manufact
uring sliced components
utilizingthestill untappedtrainable
workforce and our strategic location. Here,
we plan to integrate with global electronic
and electrical goods production as well as
inEVcomponents usingtransformation
of critical material including graphite. Our
government will also be committed to
further advancing the success of the apparel
sector.

SERVICES: A KEY DRIVER OF VALUE

A key component of the growth plan is the

MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM
ENTERPRISES (MSMES) AND THE
STARTUP ECO SYSTEM
MSMEs and start-ups are as important as the
large corporates in driving economic growth
contributing to approximately half of value
addition and half of employment. MSMEs
have been long neglected and currently
in crisis, particularly since the pandemic
and then the economic meltdown. Our
government will place special emphasis in
rescuing and setting a path for MSMEs to
become a key contributor to the expected
high growth trajectory of Sri Lanka
through access to digitization, capital and
programmes for training.

PORT CITY

PUBLIC SECTOR
MANAGEMENT AND
DIGITALIZATION

health, education and social services is vital
for economic development and civil security.
Sri Lanka‚Ñ¢s public sector is responsible
for providing these services. Yet although
12
it is massive it is plagued by overlapping
roles, redundancy, and underpayment.
Decades of reform have failed to address
corruption and accountability issues,
from public procurement to service
delivery. We plan to overhaul the public
service through digitalization and
introducing key performance indicators
to enhance productivity. This will improve

while minimizing corruption.
Establishing a SOE Holding Company is a
key part of state-owned enterprise reform.
This SOE Holding Company will provide
a centralised and strategic framework
for managing SOE ownership, under a
structurelike Singapore‚Ñ¢s ‚ÄöTemasekmodel‚Ñ¢.
What shareholding the State shall hold
in each of the SOEs shall be determined
based on multiple objectives of the various
stakeholders, balancing national security
interests with international competitiveness

BUILDING A DIGITAL HEALTH PUBLIC
INFRASTRUCTURE TO INCREASE
EFFICIENCY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Health sector will be transformed with high-
tech solutions from drug procurement to
all health services. Lessons learnt in using
digital technology in ‚Äö1990 Suwa Seriya‚Ñ¢
beingclassifiedoneof theworld‚Ñ¢smost
advanced and fastest ambulance services,
will be incorporated into enhancing quality
k
ENERGY AND UTILITY
REFORMS
Our approach in
power and energy will focus
on implementing transparent, automated
systems that minimize individual discretion,
closeloopholes formanipulation,and
eliminate the incentives for ‚Äödealmakers‚Ñ¢ to
push unsolicited proposals.
While creating competition in generation
and distribution is necessary, consumers
and industry should not bear the burden of
high energy costs due to monopoly power

purchase agreements.
We will reassess the proposed structure in
the new Act and recommend amendments
‚ÅÑ
¬Ø
Our priorities include establishing a fair
electricity market, safeguarding consumer
interests, improving accountability and
depoliticizing the industry.
We envision not just meeting but exceeding
the target of 70% renewable energy
generation by 2030, aiming to make Sri Lanka
a regional renewable energy powerhouse.
REFORMING THE
MARKET OF FACTORS
OF PRODUCTION
We shall implement factor market reforms
by relaxing restrictions on land, labor, and
capital markets to facilitate doing business
in Sri Lanka and promote both domestic and
foreign investments.
Our government is committed to
implementing a national land reforms
programme aimed at improving land
productivity and securing land rights. A
key priority will be the creation of a digital
landregistry,completingthe ongoing

Ô¨ÅBim SaviyaÔ¨Ç programme.
Recognizing the importance of human
capital development, we will prioritize
policiesaimedat improvingeducational
outcomes, developing job-relevant skills,
and fostering innovation. Enhancing the
quality and accessibility of education is
crucial to building a competitive workforce.
13
Programmes will be implemented to ensure
that Sri Lanka‚Ñ¢s workforce possesses the
skills necessary for the jobs of tomorrow.

BUILDING A STRONG
SOCIALPROTECTION
NETWORK
≈Å

For long-term sustainability, we propose
a comprehensive overhaul of Sri Lanka‚Ñ¢s
pension system. This involves creating a
universal, contributory pension scheme
that is accessible to all citizens, including
public service employees, private sector
workers,and migrant workers.The
existing model, where public servants
receive pensions without contributing, is
financially unsustainable.
≈Å

We propose to revise the minimum wage
of private sector workers to at least
Rs 25,000 per month from Rs. 17,500
per month upon discussions withall
stakeholders.
≈Å

A new intervention mechanism will soon
be established to make poverty a part of
history, drawing on the best practices of
Ô¨ÅJana Saviya,Ô¨Ç Ô¨ÅSamurdhi,Ô¨Ç Ô¨ÅAswasuma,Ô¨Ç
and Ô¨ÅGamidiriya,Ô¨Ç and developing a
comprehensive new programme. The
new programme will provide a monthly
allowance of Rs. 20,000 for up to 24
months for beneficiary families. Until the
new programme launches, Aswasuma
benefits with enhanced amounts will
continue to be disbursed as follows;

≈ÅRs. 10,000/ month (from 5,000) for
vulnerable and transitional poor families

≈Å Rs. 10,000/ month (from
8,500) for poor families

≈Å No changes to Rs. 15,000/ month for
extremely poor families
≈Å

Thisinitiativewill empowerbeneficiary
families and communities by enhancing
their capacities and skills, featuring
components of consumption, savings,
investment, production, and exports. At
its core, this programme will implement
a credit-based participatory poverty
alleviation strategy through a robust
social protection framework.
≈Å

Recognizing the tremendous impact of
the Samurdhi programme in eradicating
poverty in Sri Lanka, a fresh scientific
35
survey will be conducted before the
new programme is implemented.
This survey aims to address the mis-
targeting of beneficiaries in the current
programme,ensuringproper supportfor
underserved Samurdhi beneficiaries and

ThecapitalofSamurdhi bankswillbe
