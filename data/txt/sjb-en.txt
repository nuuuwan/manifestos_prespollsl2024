My fellow Sri Lankans,
As weapproach adefining moment in our nation™spolitical journeywith the

our vision for a positive national transformation. 
The SJS is a new political force, with a vision to create a new Sri Lanka, by introducing 
a social market economy with social justice at its core. We believe a true democracy 
is one in which every citizen™s voice is heard.
Therefore, ourmanifesto &economic visionis not justabout statisticalgrowth but 
about tangible prosperity in every segment of society. We will create a resilient 
and inclusive economy, combining the strength of free markets with a deep 

Another crucial pillar of our vision is the fight against corruption. Corruption has 
long been a stain on Sri Lanka and has ultimately led us to bankruptcy, undermining 
trust in government and robbing our citizens. The future SJS government will root 
out corruption by embedding transparency and accountability in every aspect of 
governance with the necessary system reforms. 
Inourpursuitofprosperity,specialattentionwillbeprovidedtothecrucial

be reinforced with professional and technological resources to create a healthy 
nation. The education sector will be revamped to build internationally competitive 
human capital, which can thrive in a rapidly changing world while contributing to 
the growth of Sri Lanka. 
Throughout history, nations have been developed with strong team leadership. 
This is why the SJS has assembled the most qualified and pragmatic, team of 
politicians to ensure that the ambitious goals in this manifesto are achieved.

BUILD A 
RESILIENT
 
ECONOMY
We prioritize equitable growth 
through a Social Market Economy 
model, ensuring that the benefits of 
development reach all citizens. As 
we chart a course toward economic 
recovery and lasting prosperity, we 
pledge transparency, sustainability 
and empowerment creating a future 
where all can thrive.
9
Sri Lanka is still facing its most severe 
economic crisis to date, caused by heavy 
debt, poor policy decisions, and weak 
governance. While recent steps have helped 
by lowering inflation and boosting foreign 
reserves, the road to full recovery and 
becoming an advanced economy remains 
extremely challenging. The average Sri 
Lankan has been forced to bear the brunt 
of the crisis, struggling with high prices and 
increased taxes and hopelessness.
We will follow a Social Market Economy 
model guided by Social Democratic Political 
Principles to foster equitable and inclusive 
growth, harnessing the power of markets 
while ensuring social justice and protection 
for all. Our Blueprint 3.0 provides a strategic 
plantotacklethese challenges,rebuildthe 
economy through strong growth, and secure 
a prosperous future for all. A key part of this 
plan is erasing corruption, a necessary but 

a green economy and environmental 
sustainabilityas foundational principlesfor 
economic growth and development.
To achieve sustainable growth, we need a 
two-part approach: First, we must reform 
the economy to make it more competitive 
and globally connected. This will create 
wealth among the people. Second, we 
need to ensure economic justice and equity 
through a strong social safety net with 
targeted subsidies to protect the vulnerable. 
Additionally, we will aim to increase Gross 
National Happiness (GNH) by fostering a 
society where economic progress goes hand 
inhandwiththewell-being andoverall 
happiness of our citizens.
TRANSPARENCY AND 
 
ACCOUNTABILITY
Introducing strong anti-corruption laws 
and strengthening the implementation 
of the current legal framework will speed 
up justice. The recovery of stolen assets 
and a robust programme to curb rampant 
corruptioninthecountry™s administrative 
system shall be key. Establishing an 
w
of political interference to bring to justice 
corrupt individuals will be done on an urgent 
basis by a simple amendment to legislation. 
We will enact a Public Procurement Law to 
guarantee procurement is conducted in a 

manner. All government procurement shall 
be transferred to a digital platform.
To provide the consumer with the best 
quality and price, monopolistic and 
oligopolisticbehaviorwill becorrected 
through the immediate introduction of a 
competition law.
We will bring in transparency in public 
finance management. There shall be full 
disclosure on expenditure plans and debt 
managementstrategiesaswellasintax 
administration. The establishment of 

henceforth provide detailed analysis of all 
government tax and expenditure proposals.
MANAGING THE DEBT 
CRISIS AND THE IMF
We will strengthen fiscal discipline as per the 

butnecessaryreformsto meetthetargets 
of revenue, primary balance and debt. 
However, we will make amendments to 
the current programme to guarantee relief 
to those below poverty line and improve 
quality of life for Sri Lankans. 
In the case of agreeing to a solution that 
allows for ‚claw back™ clauses for foreign 
creditors to benefit from more than 
expected GDP growth, we will insist that 
‚comparability of treatment™ be extended to 
the EPF that bore the brunt of the domestic 
debt restructure.
10
MONETARY AND 
 
EXCHANGE RATE 
POLICY
We will respect the autonomy of the Central 
Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) provided by the 
new Act but holdthe bank fully accountable 
for meeting its inflation target. Furthermore, 
we will help ensure low and stable interest 
rates, an internationally competitive foreign 
exchange rate..
ACHIEVING A 
REVENUE GROWTH
Thesolutionto increase government 
revenue is not confined to raising taxes. One 
of our first acts will be to introduce digital 
technology to increase revenue, minimize 
expenditure and corruption. We will revise 
the unfair burden sharing structure of the 
IMF supported tax code revision that is 
forcingprofessionals toseekemployment 
abroad. 
Somehighlightsof ourrevisedstructurethat 
will not disturb the overall revenue targets 
but will reduce the heavy burden on middle-
class are: 
 
Personal income tax: Personal income 

per month will start at just 1% and 
increase up to 24% income up to around 

current rates will apply for high income 
earners. 
 
Corporate income tax: We intend 
reducing up to 6% from the present 30% 
rateforprofits onexportsandintroduce 
 
(BEPS) minimum alternate tax for 
multinational companies. 
 
VAT: We intend to reduce VAT to 15% 
once tax compliance improves through 
the use of Public Digital Infrastructure to 
widening the tax net. Certain identified 
items in addition to essential food as 
consumables and inputs shall be made 
zero rated for VAT. 
 
Excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol and 
taxes on casinos will be adjusted to fund 
tax reductions. 
 
Aguaranteedupto15%savings interest 
rate will be provided for senior citizen 
savings. 
EXPENDITURE 
CONTROL
Although the IMF programme has focused 
on increasing revenue, it has not adequately 
addressed government expenditure control. 
Therefore, our economic vision aims to 
control wasteful government spending and 
corruption. This includes reforming state 
enterprises. Funds so saved will be utilized 
to implement a social safety net for the 
distressed population and to strengthen 
education and health sectors. 
We will use data-based planning to control 
government expenditure and strengthen 
transparency and accountability of 
government spending to increase public 
trust.
STIMULATING 
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Our government will be committed to 
transforming Sri Lanka into a globally 
connected social market economy, with 
private enterprise, both large and small, 
as the principal driver of growth. This 
transformation requires two key actions: 
enhancing global economic integration 
through trade liberalization and foreign 
directinvestmentand unshacklingdomestic 
markets, including product and labor 
¯
will enable full private sector engagement in 
national development.
11
 
AGRICULTURAL REFORMS 
We
 shall address challenges at multiple 
levels. Archaic laws need modernization. 
Reformswill unshackleagriculturemarkets, 
provide equitable water access through 
¯
accesstofinance andinsurance.Forthe 
individual farmer, the entire value chainŠ
from obtaining information on what, how 
much,andwhento produce,tofinancing 
inputs and managing the cultivation cycleŠ
⁄
harvest management in terms of storage to 
logistics to sale must be addressed. 
We will implement a rapid, 
 
smart technology-drivenagricultural 
modernization programme to reduce rural 
poverty, increase productivity, and promote 
sectorgrowth. This includesinterventions 
Œ in paddy, vegetable, and plantation crops 
Œ from planting to sale, like protected 

andperhaps even AI-assistedhydroponic 
¯
with the launching of the Digital Public 
Infrastructure (DPI). 
To reduce andmaintain the price ofrice 
we will reintroduce the ‚Shakthi™ rice miller 
nation-wide cooperative programme. We will 
also immediately establish ‚Prabhashwara™, 
anetworkof climate-controlledagricultural 
produce warehouses around the country to 
reducethe40%post-harvestlossofproduce. 
This too will contribute to lowering the price 
of food. 
 
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT: 
CONNECTING TO THE GLOBAL 
VALUE CHAIN
Sri Lanka will be connected to Global 
Manufacturing Value Chains (GMVCs) starting 
with manufact
uring sliced components 
utilizingthestill untappedtrainable 
workforce and our strategic location. Here, 
we plan to integrate with global electronic 
and electrical goods production as well as 
inEVcomponents usingtransformation 
of critical material including graphite. Our 
government will also be committed to 
further advancing the success of the apparel 
sector.
 
SERVICES: A KEY DRIVER OF VALUE 
CREATION
A key component of the growth plan is the 
servicesector.Wewillfocusone-commerce 
and information technology services and

MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM 
ENTERPRISES (MSMES) AND THE 
STARTUP ECO SYSTEM 
MSMEs and start-ups are as important as the 
large corporates in driving economic growth 
contributing to approximately half of value 
addition and half of employment. MSMEs 
have been long neglected and currently 
in crisis, particularly since the pandemic 
and then the economic meltdown. Our 
government will place special emphasis in 
rescuing and setting a path for MSMEs to 
become a key contributor to the expected 
high growth trajectory of Sri Lanka 
through access to digitization, capital and 
programmes for training.
 
PORT CITY

PUBLIC SECTOR 
MANAGEMENT AND 
DIGITALIZATION 

health, education and social services is vital 
for economic development and civil security. 
Sri Lanka™s public sector is responsible 
for providing these services. Yet although 
12
it is massive it is plagued by overlapping 
roles, redundancy, and underpayment. 
Decades of reform have failed to address 
corruption and accountability issues, 
from public procurement to service 
delivery. We plan to overhaul the public 
service through digitalization and 
introducing key performance indicators 
to enhance productivity. This will improve 

while minimizing corruption. 
Establishing a SOE Holding Company is a 
key part of state-owned enterprise reform. 
This SOE Holding Company will provide 
a centralised and strategic framework 
for managing SOE ownership, under a 
structurelike Singapore™s ‚Temasekmodel™. 
What shareholding the State shall hold 
in each of the SOEs shall be determined 
based on multiple objectives of the various 
stakeholders, balancing national security 
interests with international competitiveness 

 
BUILDING A DIGITAL HEALTH PUBLIC 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO INCREASE 
EFFICIENCY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
Health sector will be transformed with high-
tech solutions from drug procurement to 
all health services. Lessons learnt in using 
digital technology in ‚1990 Suwa Seriya™ 
beingclassifiedoneof theworld™smost 
advanced and fastest ambulance services, 
will be incorporated into enhancing quality 
k
ENERGY AND UTILITY 
REFORMS
Our approach in 
power and energy will focus 
on implementing transparent, automated 
systems that minimize individual discretion, 
closeloopholes formanipulation,and 
eliminate the incentives for ‚dealmakers™ to 
push unsolicited proposals.
While creating competition in generation 
and distribution is necessary, consumers 
and industry should not bear the burden of 
high energy costs due to monopoly power 



purchase agreements.
We will reassess the proposed structure in 
the new Act and recommend amendments 
⁄
¯
Our priorities include establishing a fair 
electricity market, safeguarding consumer 
interests, improving accountability and 
depoliticizing the industry.
We envision not just meeting but exceeding 
the target of 70% renewable energy 
generation by 2030, aiming to make Sri Lanka 
a regional renewable energy powerhouse.
REFORMING THE 
MARKET OF FACTORS 
OF PRODUCTION
We shall implement factor market reforms 
by relaxing restrictions on land, labor, and 
capital markets to facilitate doing business 
in Sri Lanka and promote both domestic and 
foreign investments.
Our government is committed to 
implementing a national land reforms 
programme aimed at improving land 
productivity and securing land rights. A 
key priority will be the creation of a digital 
landregistry,completingthe ongoing 
 
ﬁBim Saviyaﬂ programme.
Recognizing the importance of human 
capital development, we will prioritize 
policiesaimedat improvingeducational 
outcomes, developing job-relevant skills, 
and fostering innovation. Enhancing the 
quality and accessibility of education is 
crucial to building a competitive workforce.

Under future governance, we commit 
to granting a reasonable extension to 
this suspension. Additionally, we will 
mandate all state and commercial 
banks to establish dedicated MSME loan 
departments. These departments will 
analyze loan situations on a case-by-case

them by enabling them to provide 
currently cumbersome services such 
as obtaining birth, marriage, and death 
certificates, passports, and certified 
copies of important documents with the 
press of a button.

BUILDING A STRONG 
SOCIALPROTECTION 
NETWORK
Ł
 
For long-term sustainability, we propose 
a comprehensive overhaul of Sri Lanka™s 
pension system. This involves creating a 
universal, contributory pension scheme 
that is accessible to all citizens, including 
public service employees, private sector 
workers,and migrant workers.The 
existing model, where public servants 
receive pensions without contributing, is 
financially unsustainable. 
Ł
 
We propose to revise the minimum wage 
of private sector workers to at least 
Rs 25,000 per month from Rs. 17,500 
per month upon discussions withall 
stakeholders. 
Ł
 
A new intervention mechanism will soon 
be established to make poverty a part of 
history, drawing on the best practices of 
ﬁJana Saviya,ﬂ ﬁSamurdhi,ﬂ ﬁAswasuma,ﬂ 
and ﬁGamidiriya,ﬂ and developing a 
comprehensive new programme. The 
new programme will provide a monthly 
allowance of Rs. 20,000 for up to 24 
months for beneficiary families. Until the 
new programme launches, Aswasuma 
benefits with enhanced amounts will 
continue to be disbursed as follows;
 
ŁRs. 10,000/ month (from 5,000) for 
vulnerable and transitional poor families
 
Ł Rs. 10,000/ month (from 
8,500) for poor families
 
Ł No changes to Rs. 15,000/ month for 
extremely poor families
Ł
 
Thisinitiativewill empowerbeneficiary 
families and communities by enhancing 
their capacities and skills, featuring 
components of consumption, savings, 
investment, production, and exports. At 
its core, this programme will implement 
a credit-based participatory poverty 
alleviation strategy through a robust 
social protection framework.
Ł
 
Recognizing the tremendous impact of 
the Samurdhi programme in eradicating 
poverty in Sri Lanka, a fresh scientific 
35
survey will be conducted before the 
new programme is implemented. 
This survey aims to address the mis-
targeting of beneficiaries in the current 
programme,ensuringproper supportfor 
underserved Samurdhi beneficiaries and 

ThecapitalofSamurdhi bankswillbe

We will implement a fuel subsidy through 
a QR-based system, benefiting farmers,
